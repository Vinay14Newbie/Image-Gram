Express.Router

Use the express.Router class to create modular, mountable route handlers. A Router instance is a complete middleware and routing system; for this reason, it is often referred to as a “mini-app”.




Step-by-Step Explanation

1) Import Required Modules:

express: Used to create the router instance.
s3uploader: Middleware for handling image uploads to AWS S3.
createPost and findAllPosts: Controller functions to handle the logic for creating and retrieving posts.

2) Create a Router Instance:

const router = express.Router(); creates a new router instance. This router object will act like a mini Express app that can hold multiple routes.
The router allows you to keep routes modular and organized by functionality, e.g., all "post" related routes in one file.

3) Define Routes:

router.post('/posts', s3uploader.single('image'), createPost);:

This route handles creating a new post.
It uses s3uploader.single('image') as middleware to upload an image to AWS S3.
After the image is uploaded, the createPost controller is called to handle creating the post.

router.get('/posts', findAllPosts);:

This route handles retrieving all posts.
It calls findAllPosts, which retrieves all posts from the database and sends them as the response.

4)Export the Router:

export default router; makes this router available to be imported and used in other files, like your main index.js file, where you’ll attach it to a specific path (e.g., /api or /api/v1).
